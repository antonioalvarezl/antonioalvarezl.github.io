<br>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.uam.es/UAM/Home.htm?language=en">Universidad Autónoma de Madrid</a> (affiliated with <a href="https://www.icmat.es/en/">Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas</a>) and <a href="https://www.fau.eu/">Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</a>. My research focuses on the mathematical foundations of machine learning, specifically on the analysis and control of continuous-time neural network architectures such as neural ODEs and flow-based generative models.<br><br>
<p>
Currently, I am visiting my PhD advisor <a href="https://dcn.nat.fau.eu/enrique-zuazua/">Prof. Enrique Zuazua</a> at <a href="https://www.fau.eu/">Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</a>, following a very fruitful research stay at the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> (August – November 2025), where I worked with <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/qianxiaoli/">Prof. Qianxiao Li</a> on advanced topics in machine learning theory.

<b>Updates:</b><br><br>

<ul style="height: 300px; overflow: auto">
	<li><i>January 2025:</i>  New preprint on arXiv!</strong> In collaboration with Borjan Geshkovski and Domènec Ruiz-Balet, we uploaded our work <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2601.21366">"Perceptrons and localization of attention's mean-field landscape". We study the forward pass of Transformers as interacting particle systems on the sphere, analyzing how the perceptron block affects the mean-field limit and showing that its critical points are generically atomic and localized.
	<li><i>December 2025:</i> I attended the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ims-icsds2025/">IMS International Conference on Statistics and Data Science (ICSDS)</a> in Seville. I had the honor of receiving the <b>Student Travel Award</b> from Richard Samworth in person. I also presented my talk <i>"Continuous-Time Learning of Probability Distributions via Neural ODEs with Applications in Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data"</i>. It was a fantastic experience connecting with the statistics community and enjoying the plenary sessions in such a lovely city!
	</li><br>
	<li><i>November 2025:</i> I completed my research stay at the <b>National University of Singapore</b>. It was an incredibly productive period where I learned a lot and met brilliant researchers. I am now back at <b>FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg</b> visiting my PhD advisor, while working on a couple of ongoing projects from NUS that I'm very excited about.
    </li><br>
	<li><i>October 2025:</i> New preprint on arXiv!</strong> In collaboration with fellow PhD student Martin Hernández, we uploaded our work 
	  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13134">"Convergence, design and training of continuous-time dropout as a random batch method"</a>. 
	We study the dropout technique for continuous-time models as random batch methods for interacting particles, 
	  providing a novel theoretical framework.
	</li><br>
	<li><i>October 2025:</i> I decided to create this personal website to share my research and academic activities.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>September 2025:</i> I received the <b> Student Travel Award</b> at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ims-icsds2025/">IMS International Conference on Statistics and Data Science (ICSDS) 2025</a>. I will be presenting my work at the conference in mid December.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>September 2025:</i> I gave two seminars on "Entropy-driven control of the continuity equation for normalizing flows":
		<ul>
			<li>September 29: <b>Machine Learning and Scientific Computing Seminar</b>, National University of Singapore</li>
			<li>September 16: <b>Nonlinear PDE Seminar</b>, Department of Mathematics, Texas A&M University</li>
		</ul>
	</li><br>

	<li><i>August 2025:</i> I started a 3-month research visit at the <b>National University of Singapore</b>, working with Prof. Qianxiao Li's group on mathematical foundations of machine learning.
