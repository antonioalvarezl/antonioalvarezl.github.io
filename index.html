<br>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.uam.es/UAM/Home.htm?language=en">Universidad Autónoma de Madrid</a> (affiliated with <a href="https://www.icmat.es/en/">Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas</a>) and <a href="https://www.fau.eu/">Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</a>. My research focuses on the mathematical foundations of machine learning, specifically on the analysis and control of continuous-time neural network architectures such as transformers and flow-based generative models.<br><br>

Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a>, working with <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/qianxiaoli/">Prof. Qianxiao Li</a> on advanced topics in machine learning theory and scientific computing.<br><br>

<b>Updates:</b><br><br>

<ul style="height: 300px; overflow: auto">
	<li><i>October 2025:</i> New preprint on arXiv!</strong> In collaboration with fellow PhD student Martin Hernández, we uploaded our preprint 
	  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13134">"Convergence, design and training of continuous-time dropout as a random batch method"</a>. 
	In this work, we study the dropout technique for continuous-time models as random batch methods for interacting particles, 
	  providing a novel theoretical framework.
	</li><br>
	<li><i>October 2025:</i> I decided to create this personal website to share my research and academic activities.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>September 2025:</i> I received the <b> Student Travel Award</b> at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ims-icsds2025/">IMS International Conference on Statistics and Data Science (ICSDS) 2025</a>. I will be presenting my work at the conference in mid December.
	</li><br>

	<li><i>September 2025:</i> I gave two seminars on "Entropy-driven control of the continuity equation for normalizing flows":
		<ul>
			<li>September 29: <b>Machine Learning and Scientific Computing Seminar</b>, National University of Singapore</li>
			<li>September 16: <b>Nonlinear PDE Seminar</b>, Department of Mathematics, Texas A&M University</li>
		</ul>
	</li><br>

	<li><i>August 2025:</i> I started a 3-month research visit at the <b>National University of Singapore</b>, working with Prof. Qianxiao Li's group on mathematical foundations of machine learning.
