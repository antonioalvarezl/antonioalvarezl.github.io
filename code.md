## **Interactive Demos**

**ReLU Flow Simulator**  
Interactive visualization tool to explore density evolution under piecewise-linear flows driven by a single ReLU unit. Features multi-step composition, supports 1D and 2D, and offers both population (analytical) and empirical (particle-based) views.

**ReLU Point Simulator**  
Interactive demo for exploring the evolution of point clouds under single-unit ReLU Neural ODEs. Includes free exploration, interpolation tracking, and classification modes with separability and cross-entropy metrics.

## **Research Code**

**Neural ODE Classification Framework**  
Complete implementation of the cluster-based classification approach with Neural ODEs from our paper. Includes synthetic and real-world dataset support (MNIST, CIFAR-10), multiple architectures (inside, outside, bottleneck), visualization tools, and trajectory animations.

*Paper:* Cluster-based classification with neural ODEs via control (CMS, 2025)

**Gaussian Mixture Optimization**  
Comparison framework for evaluating different loss functions (KL divergence, L1, L2) in gradient descent optimization. Supports flexible parameter optimization (means, variances, weights), multiple optimization methods (standard GD, alternating GD, Adam, stage-wise), and generates visualizations and animations of the optimization process.
