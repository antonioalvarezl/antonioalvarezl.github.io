## **Interactive Demos & Tools**

**BibTeX Merger**  
Python tool to merge multiple `.bib` files into a single, reliable bibliography without losing citation keys (e.g., when preparing a thesis).

**ReLU Neural ODE Point Simulator**  
Interactive demo for exploring the evolution of point clouds under single-unit ReLU Neural ODEs. Includes free exploration, interpolation tracking, and classification modes with separability and cross-entropy metrics.
